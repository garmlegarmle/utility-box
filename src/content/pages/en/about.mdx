Utility Box is a multilingual static platform for practical tools, games, and guides.

Our content model is intentionally simple:

- fixed page templates
- markdown or MDX content files
- Git-based publishing workflow

If you want to contribute a page, add a new file under `src/content/pages/en` or `src/content/pages/ko`.
